        "This notebook allows you to validate remerge provided uplift reporting numbers. To do so it downloads and analyses exported campaign and event data from S3. The campaign data contains all users that remerge marked to be part of an uplift test, the A/B group assignment, the timestamp of marking, conversion events (click, app open or similar) and their cost. The event data reflects the app event stream and includes events, their timestamp and revenue (if any). We calculate the incremental revenue and the iROAS in line with the [remerge whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PTJ93Cpjw1BeiVns8dTcs2zDDWmmjpdc/view). \n",
